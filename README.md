# ue-beach

I made this scene in Unreal Engine 5 to work on my landscaping abilities near water. I made a rocky beach with some smaller rocks & details (like buoys) to practice my skills & get an idea down. I like how the end result was, since I think the lighting looks great on the water. I uploaded the FBX files (which Unreal Engine let me export), and then also converted those to STL files.
